# TFG - Amueblado de propiedades en 3D

## Furnishing propieties in 3D
  
Floorfy is one of the companies that is dedicated to making three-dimensional renderings of homes for real estate. These renders are called virtual tours. This service has many advantages and facilities for the user. Floorfy is counting on me to create a new application within these virtual tours that is based on furnishing a property using three-dimensional models, in addition to the possibility of changing the colors and textures of the objects, floors and walls that are in it. To do this, it will also be necessary to add a catalog with the available models and textures, in addition to adding some controls so that the user can handle the new tool well. This new functionality that Floorfy will offer allows the user to preview a property furnished to their liking before a possible acquisition, in order to get an idea of how it would look with a specific decoration.
